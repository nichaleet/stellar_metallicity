;
; Generates an array of Gaussian emission lines to be used as templates in PPXF.
; Additional lines can be easily added by editing this procedure.
;
; - logLam_temp is the natural log of the wavelength of the templates in Angstrom.
; logLam_temp should be the same as that of the stellar templates.
;
; - lamRange_gal is the estimated rest-frame fitted wavelength range
; Typically lamRange_gal = [min(wave), max(wave)]/(1 + z),
; where wave is the observed wavelength of the fitted galaxy pixels
; and z is an initial very rough estimate of the galaxy redshift.
;
; - FWHM_gal is the instrumantal FWHM of the galaxy spectrum under study in
; Angstrom. Here it is assumed constant. It could be a function of wavelength.
;
;- The [OI], [OIII] and [NII] doublets are fixed at theoretical flux ratio~3.
