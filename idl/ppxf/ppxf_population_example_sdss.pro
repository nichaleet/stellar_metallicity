; Read the list of filenames from the Single Stellar Population library
; by Vazdekis et al. (2010, MNRAS, 404, 1639) http://miles.iac.es/.
; 
; For this example I downloaded from the above website a set of 
; model spectra with default linear sampling of 0.9A/pix and default 
; spectral resolution of FWHM=2.51A. I selected a Salpeter IMF 
; (slope 1.30) and a range of population parameters:
; 
;     [M/H] = [-1.71, -1.31, -0.71, -0.40, 0.00, 0.22]
;     Age = range(1.0, 17.7828, 26, /LOG)
;     
; This leads to a set of 156 model spectra with the file names like
;   
;     Mun1.30Zm0.40T03.9811.fits
;     
; IMPORTANT: the selected models form a rectangular grid in [M/H] 
; and Age: for each Age the spectra sample the same set of [M/H].
;     
; We assume below that the model spectra have been placed in the 
; directory "miles_models" under the current directory.

; A simple alphabetical ordering of Vazdekis's naming convention
; does not sort the files by [M/H], so we do it explicitly below
