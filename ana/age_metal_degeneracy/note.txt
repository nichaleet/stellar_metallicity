The following are how to get additional uncertainties in 100417cl0024ana_new.pro and earlier
It assumed that the uncertainties are independent of age (taking the median over several ages) and assumed symmetric gaussian uncertainty.
1) run degeneracy to create fits files in output directory. Fits files contain chisq images of each best [Fe/H] and age value
2) run make_worm_plot to create a plot for paper (optional)
3) run get_uncertainty_fn.pro to create a 'uncertainty_fn_feh_sn.fits' a structure that contain theoretical uncertainties at each metallicity and SN

The following are used in cl0024ana_new.pro (later than above)
1) get_additional_uncertainties_cl0024.pro, which uses make_chisqarr_new.pro.
It creates a grid of chisq for each galaxy and probabilities 
2) get_prob_dist.pro  (create a 3 frames fits file: prob grid for age and metals, prob array for metals, prob array for age

to create mock MZR with formation redshifts and test if the age-metallcities can explain the scatter, see
test_degeneracy_formation_time.pro

Then... Evan suggested that I should use the age, mass, and noise array from observed data.
This will be done in test_degeneracy_formation_time2.pro

The first two versions above (test_degeneracy_formation_time.pro and test_degeneracy_formation_time2.pro) use MZR function from Moustakas11, Zahid13 or the log function form of gas-phase MZR. But later we found out that the log form doesn't really describe our data well nor the 2 degree polynomial (see the dotted line in Cl0024_FeH_mass_polyfit.eps). So we decided to go with the simple linear fit.

y=mx+c where print, [c,m]=[-1.8654625,0.17579233] and delta[c,m]=[0.11082823,0.010527926]
The best fit params were obtained from cl0024ana.pro

So same thing as the test_degeneracy_formation_time2.pro but with this linear function is done in test_degeneracy_formation_time3.pro

Then I changed the sample from early-type to passive galaxies
so this is done in in test_degeneracy_formation_time4.pro

Then things are improved more in test_degeneracy_formation_time5.pro Here the MZR linear equation has an intercept at 10^10 Msun.
There is an evolution detected so the mock SDSS will have diff linear equation from mock CL. Also, the uncertainties now are non-gaussian.
